SMU Asthma Health
=============
The SMU Asthma Health is the extension of the original Apple Asthma project. The app is intregrated with the OpenSpirometry module, developed by Dr. Eric C. Larson, Southern Methodist University, Dallas TX. This module is enable users to perform Spirometry test. Note that, the system is currenly in the beginning of developing stage, so some modules are not available.

The Asthma Mobile Health study is a personalized app that helps individuals gain greater insight into their asthma, adhere to treatment plans, and avoid triggers. The app presents a variety of surveys to better understand unique triggers for asthma exacerbations, and connects with HealthKit to track inhaler usage and peak flow values.

Other components
================

The [EuroQoL EQ-5D](http://www.euroqol.org/about-eq-5d.html) survey instrument
is used in the shipping app, but has been removed from the open source
version because it is not free to use.

The shipping app also uses OpenSSL to add extra data protection, which
has not been included in the published version of the AppCore
project. See the [AppCore repository](https://github.com/researchkit/AppCore) for more details.

Data upload to [Bridge](http://sagebase.org/bridge/) has been disabled, the logos of the institutions have been removed, and the consent material has been marked as an example.
